# Date: October 13th, 2022
# Purpose of the program: It is possible to name the days 0 through 6 where day 0 is
# Sunday and day 6 is Saturday. If you go on a wonderful holiday leaving on day number 3 (Wednesday)
# and you return home after 10 nights, then you would return home on Saturday (day 6).
# Write a general version of the program which asks for the starting day number,
# and the length of your stay, and it will tell you the number of the day you will return on.

#User's answer is the length of the vacation.

returnDay = float(returnDay) #declares that variable must be a number.
print("The number of the day youâ€™ll return: ", returnDay) #prints number of day you will return.
