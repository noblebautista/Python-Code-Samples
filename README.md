# Python-Code-Samples

***MODULE 8***

Coding assignments for Module #8's lab assignment. Assignments consisted of using functions and boolean algebra in order to test different problems. Below are the file names and descriptions to follow along with more clarification.


• Mod8Prob1.py: Two numbers are randomly generated between 1 and 20 (boundary inclusive). To test for equality, write a function that returns True if two numbers are equal and False otherwise. The program repeats until two identical numbers are produced. Once equal, it prints the two numbers as well as the number of times the function called. 

• Mod8Prob2.py: Write a function that takes three inputs from a user and prints the largest number without using max(). Generate three integer values using random.randint(1, 30)

• Mod8Prob3.py: Write a function that takes a list containing five numbers generated by random.randint(1, 5) and prints whether the value 4 is in that list.

• Mod8Prob4.py: Write a function that takes each element of a list called years and returns True if it is a leap year or False otherwise. Create a list of leap years that includes leap years only after checking each element of the list years. Your result should be checked with the calendar.isleap() function.

• Mod8Prob5.py: Write a function that prints “All items are ready.” if your game character has picked up all the items needed to perform certain task. And checks the character’s defuff state is the same as that of the task.


***MODULE 7***

Coding assignments for Module #7's lab assignment. Assignments consisted of testing out creating and using Python functions, many of them being user defined functions that used for loops and imported modules to streamline coding (i.e. math, random, turtle, etc). Below are the file names and descriptions to follow along with for more clarification.

• VolOfSphere.py (Problem 1): Write a function VolOfSphere(r) which returns the volume of a sphere of radius r. Make sure you use the math module in your solution.

• CheckRange.py (Problem 2): Write a Python function CheckRange(number) to check whether a number is in a given range (1, 10). The number should be randomly generated 20 times in the range (1, 15). Print how many times a number is in a given range.

• SumOfFood.py (Problem 3): Write a Python function SumOfFood(foodDict) that sums the price of each food item in a dictionary. Use foodDict = {“Pizza”: 3.50, “Sandwich”: 5.30, “Hamburger”: $9.45, “Spaghetti”: 5.75}

• Unique.py (Problem 4): Write a Python function Unique(lst) that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list with unique elements of the given list. Use lst = [1, 3, 3, 3, 6, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4, 2]. Use the append function to create a new list where elements are unique. The count function should not be used to identify elements that appear more than once in a list.

• Squares.py (Problem 5): Write a Python function Squares(t, sz) using the following chunk of code as a base to produce the image shown. Assume the innermost square is 20 units per side, and each successive square is 20 units bigger per side, than the one inside it. below. Use t as an instance of turtle object and sz as length of each side.

• Flower.py (Problem 6): Write a Python function Flower(t, sz) using the polygon program from the last module. Call the function in a way to create a pattern similar to below. Use t as an instance of turtle object and sz as length of each side.

***MODULE 6***

Coding assignments for Module #6's lab assignment. Assignments consisted of testing out common Python modules, including Random & Math. Below are notes to follow along for more clairfication for each file.

•	Problem 1 – randomrange.py: Use a for statement and random.randrange to print 10 random integers between 25 and 35. 

•	Problem 2 – randomint.py: Use random.randint to print an odd integer between 0 and 100.

•	Problem 3 – randomday.py: Use random.choice to select a day of the week from a list and print that day. 

•	Problem 4 – pi.py: Calculate an approximation for pi using Leibniz’s formula, which is one of algorithms calculating the mathematical constant pi. Write a program that approximates π  according to the Leibniz’s formula using the following pseudo codes. Then compare the result with the value of math.pi in the math module.

•	Problem 5 – degrees.py:Convert radians to degrees using 2π rad = 360°. Write a program to convert a user input value in radians to the value in degrees. Print this value to compare it to a value computed using the degrees function in the math module for the same input value.

•	Problem 6 – factorial.py: Write a program that uses a for loop to compute the factorial of a user input value. Print the result to compare to be compared with the calculated value using the factorial function in the math module. 

***MODULE 5***

Coding assignments for Module #5's lab assignment. Assignments consisted of testing out for loops, as well as creating turtle designs/drawings. Below are notes to follow along for more clairfication for each file.

-Problem1_Mod5Lab.py
o	Consider a program that asks the user to enter a number and prints “Hello World” by that number. 

-Problem2_Mod5Lab.py
o Assume you have a list of numbers 4, 10, 13, 3, 6, 7, 42, 9, 20. Write a loop that prints each of the numbers on a new line.

-Problem3_Mod5Lab.py
o Consider a program that prints the integers from 1 to 50. If a number is multiples of three, then prints “Divisible by three” instead of printing the number and for the multiples of seven prints “Divisible by seven”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and seven print “Divisible by both”.  

-Problem4_Mod5Lab.py
o Write a program that asks the user for the number of sides, the length of the side, the color of the line, and the fill color of a regular polygon. The program should draw the polygon and then fill it with the user inputted color. 

-Problem5_Mod5Lab.py
o Choose one of the following drawings. Then write a program to draw what you choose with the turtle methods provided in Summary of Turtle Methods (Picture chosen: five rings in different colors; International Olympics logo).
