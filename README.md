***MODULE 4***

Coding assignments for Module #4's lab assignment. This was a debugging assignment for Python code. Descriptions of each project are in commentary within select code Below are notes with the amout of errors found along with the specific type of error.

-	collections.py
o	#Of Errors: FIVE (5)
o	Error Types (each): Variable Error (misspelled), Syntax Error (Ending bracket missing/in wrong place), Syntax Error (missing comma), Syntax Error (parenthesis), Syntax Error (print statement (commas, unnecessary operators)).

-	branching.py
o	#Of Errors: SIX (6)
o	Error Types (each): Syntax Error (period instead of parenthesis), Syntax error (wrong operator used), Syntax Error (no colon), Syntax Error (quotations), Syntax Error (incorrect operator), Value Error (elif statement formula missing).

-	grading.py
o	#Of Errors: SIXTEEN (16)
o	Error Types (each): Syntax Error (unmatched parenthesis (did not call integer properly)), Variable Error (exam_3 should be exam_three), Syntax Error (should call int not str), Syntax Error (missing commas when defining “grades” variable),  Syntax Error (missing colon in elif statement),  Syntax Error (missing quotations around “C”), Syntax Error (incorrect operator used for B grade parameters), Syntax Error (missing function for elif statement for F grade), Value Error (Elif statement parameters for C grade), Value Error (elif statement parameters for D grade), Syntax Error (missing parenthesis in call to print), Syntax Error (again, missing parenthesis in call to print), Syntax Error (wrong operator (used “is” instead of “==”)),Variable Error (grades is misspelled), Variable error (grade should have been grades), Variable Error (Letter-grade should have been Letter_grade)

o	#Of Errors: FOUR (4)
o	Error Types (each): Syntax Error (missing quotations), Syntax Error (opening brackets did not match closing parenthesis), Value Error (elif statement should be an else statement), Syntax Error (properly indent print statement for else statement).

-	time2.py

o	Error Types (each): Value Error (hours misspelled), Value Error (“wait_time” variable misspelled), Value Error (“time_when_to_start” variable does not exist, should print “time_when_start”)

***MODULE 3***

List of all Module 3 lab problems with their descriptions (clarifying commentary will be in code files):

Problem 1 – Write a program that prints your name with a greeting message. 

Problem 2 – Write a program that prints three items, such as your name, your favorite movie, the city name you live in. 

Problem 3 – Write a program that prints the sum of the first ten positive integers, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
5 + …+ 9 + 10.  

Problem 4 - Write a program that computes the area of a circle. Prompt the user to enter the radius and print the answer with a nice message. 

Problem 5 - Write a program that computes the MPG (Miles per Gas) for a car. Prompt the user to enter the number of miles driven and the number of gallons it used. Print the answer with a message. 

Problem 6 - Write a program that prints the balance of an account after the first, second, and third year. The account has an initial balance of $1,000 and earns 5 percent interest per year. 

Problem 7 - It is possible to name the days 0 through 6 where day 0 is Sunday and day 6 is Saturday. If you go on a wonderful holiday leaving on day number 3 (Wednesday) and you return home after 10 nights, then you would return home on Saturday (day 6). Write a general version of the program which asks for the starting day number, and the length of your stay, and it will tell you the number of the day you will return on. 

Problem 8 – Write a program that prints a house that looks exactly like the following (see problem 8 code file)
