# Python-Code-Samples
***MODULE 5***

Coding assignments for Module #5's lab assignment. Assignments consisted of testing out for loops, as well as creating turtle designs/drawings. Below are notes to follow along for more clairfication for each file.

-Problem1_Mod5Lab.py
o	Consider a program that asks the user to enter a number and prints “Hello World” by that number. 

-Problem2_Mod5Lab.py
o Assume you have a list of numbers 4, 10, 13, 3, 6, 7, 42, 9, 20. Write a loop that prints each of the numbers on a new line.

-Problem3_Mod5Lab.py
o Consider a program that prints the integers from 1 to 50. If a number is multiples of three, then prints “Divisible by three” instead of printing the number and for the multiples of seven prints “Divisible by seven”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and seven print “Divisible by both”.  

-Problem4_Mod5Lab.py
o Write a program that asks the user for the number of sides, the length of the side, the color of the line, and the fill color of a regular polygon. The program should draw the polygon and then fill it with the user inputted color. 

-Problem5_Mod5Lab.py
o Choose one of the following drawings. Then write a program to draw what you choose with the turtle methods provided in Summary of Turtle Methods (Picture chosen: five rings in different colors; International Olympics logo).

***MODULE 4***

Coding assignments for Module #4's lab assignment. This was a debugging assignment for Python code. Descriptions of each project are in commentary within select code Below are notes with the amout of errors found along with the specific type of error.

-	collections.py
o	#Of Errors: FIVE (5)
o	Error Types (each): Variable Error (misspelled), Syntax Error (Ending bracket missing/in wrong place), Syntax Error (missing comma), Syntax Error (parenthesis), Syntax Error (print statement (commas, unnecessary operators)).

-	branching.py
o	#Of Errors: SIX (6)
o	Error Types (each): Syntax Error (period instead of parenthesis), Syntax error (wrong operator used), Syntax Error (no colon), Syntax Error (quotations), Syntax Error (incorrect operator), Value Error (elif statement formula missing).

-	grading.py
o	#Of Errors: SIXTEEN (16)
o	Error Types (each): Syntax Error (unmatched parenthesis (did not call integer properly)), Variable Error (exam_3 should be exam_three), Syntax Error (should call int not str), Syntax Error (missing commas when defining “grades” variable),  Syntax Error (missing colon in elif statement),  Syntax Error (missing quotations around “C”), Syntax Error (incorrect operator used for B grade parameters), Syntax Error (missing function for elif statement for F grade), Value Error (Elif statement parameters for C grade), Value Error (elif statement parameters for D grade), Syntax Error (missing parenthesis in call to print), Syntax Error (again, missing parenthesis in call to print), Syntax Error (wrong operator (used “is” instead of “==”)),Variable Error (grades is misspelled), Variable error (grade should have been grades), Variable Error (Letter-grade should have been Letter_grade)

-	pirate.py
o	#Of Errors: FOUR (4)
o	Error Types (each): Syntax Error (missing quotations), Syntax Error (opening brackets did not match closing parenthesis), Value Error (elif statement should be an else statement), Syntax Error (properly indent print statement for else statement).

-	time2.py
o	#Of Errors:
o	Error Types (each): Value Error (hours misspelled), Value Error (“wait_time” variable misspelled), Value Error (“time_when_to_start” variable does not exist, should print “time_when_start”)

***MODULE 3***

List of all Module 3 lab problems with their descriptions (clarifying commentary will be in code files):

Problem 1 – Write a program that prints your name with a greeting message. 

Problem 2 – Write a program that prints three items, such as your name, your favorite movie, the city name you live in. 

Problem 3 – Write a program that prints the sum of the first ten positive integers, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
5 + …+ 9 + 10.  

Problem 4 - Write a program that computes the area of a circle. Prompt the user to enter the radius and print the answer with a nice message. 

Problem 5 - Write a program that computes the MPG (Miles per Gas) for a car. Prompt the user to enter the number of miles driven and the number of gallons it used. Print the answer with a message. 

Problem 6 - Write a program that prints the balance of an account after the first, second, and third year. The account has an initial balance of $1,000 and earns 5 percent interest per year. 

Problem 7 - It is possible to name the days 0 through 6 where day 0 is Sunday and day 6 is Saturday. If you go on a wonderful holiday leaving on day number 3 (Wednesday) and you return home after 10 nights, then you would return home on Saturday (day 6). Write a general version of the program which asks for the starting day number, and the length of your stay, and it will tell you the number of the day you will return on. 

Problem 8 – Write a program that prints a house that looks exactly like the following (see problem 8 code file)
